# FOSS Pay

Many FOSS (Free and OpenSource Software)-Developers are not payed for their work.  
We believe that changing that is possible.

With FOSS Pay it is easier than ever to contribute to FOSS by tipping a Developer or even donating to a Foundation.

(FOSS Pay is not yet released - Coming soon...)
